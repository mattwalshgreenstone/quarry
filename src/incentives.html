	<h3>Incentives Program</h3>


	<p>Our incentives program is now open to the Quarry! Introduce Green Stone to a client or project that we wind up working with, and you'll get paid accordingly. Bonus points if you wind up working on it with us! </p>

	<p>If you have something in mind, email me at: matt.walsh@greenstone.co</p>

	<p>Thanks again for being a part of Green Stone. As always if I can do anything for you - on or off the clock - please let me know. It would be my pleasure.</p>
